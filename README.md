This repositoory contains the original version of the downscaling files written by Laura Puckett as part of an undergraduate research project in 2018. The scripts have since been added the repository for the FLARE project and the most up-to-date version are available there (https://github.com/CareyLabVT/FLARE/tree/master/Rscripts/met_downscale).  

 Running "run_downscaling.R" kicks off the downscaling process and calls functions that are stored in the other files within this repo.
